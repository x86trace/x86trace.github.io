# Enumeration

![](../../assets/writeups/2023-12-26-CTF-200-01/portscan.png)

#### Port 80

Just a default apache page. Tried `dirb` and nothing much.



#### Port 8338

Running maltrail v0.52, Googling for a bit and i was able to find the exploit for the maltrail uptil version v0.53



[Maltrail POC](https://github.com/SethJGibson/Hummingbird-Maltrail-RCE-PoC/blob/main/hummingbird.py)



## Getting User

Now, we run the poc and get the User Shell,

And now we upgrade the shell and run linpeas to find our way to privesc.




## Getting Root

There were quite a few methods to root the machine, i choose a simple command injection into `.sh` file which was running as root and we had write permission to it(Found in LinPEAS.sh result).

```bash
echo "chmod u+s /bin/bash" >> /var/backups/etc_Backup.sh
```

And after couple of seconds we can just do,

```bash
/bin/bash -p
```
