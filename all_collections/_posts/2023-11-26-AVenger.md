## Reconnaissance

We start with the basic nmap scan

we see quite a few ports open but what we will come to it later and lets visit the site first and use `gobuster` to enumerate the `web directories`

```bash

and we have couple of 301 and couple of 403, so we try to visit the 301 `dir.`
of which the most interesting and useful was `/gift`

![](https://imgur.com/Fy7E0Hh.png)

visiting `/gift` we see a blog kind of page and of which when scroling down i saw a contact page which had upload button

![](https://imgur.com/LNTR2W0.png)

![](https://imgur.com/vikzzWG.png)

so time to get a shell, basically i came across a lot of problems here so i tried pretty much everything and was on the verge of giving up but then after lot of tries something clicked which was what if the server(backend) is running /opening the file in order to check because once you get a successful upload it says

![](https://i.imgur.com/X8aOpBC.png)

see how it says **Our team is delighted to review every message carefully** therefore we need to get crafty with this and now comes how i got a shell

## Foothold

Using that upload file and lot of tries i came to a conclusion that what if the server is running something like ```cmd.exe /c "payload_goes_here"``` so now read couple of documentations and blogs and find out this great blog [command execution to shell](https://mayfly277.github.io/posts/GOADv2-pwning-part7/#command-execution-to-shell)

so i utilise that py script and craft a payload to upload it

![](https://i.imgur.com/cmC9Hus.png)

and we create a `.cmd` and upload it and wait for it too get run and we wait to get a shell

![](https://imgur.com/HmuJoIa.png)

and also we get our first flag which is in `/Users/hugo/Desktop`

## Administrator

now once i got the shell i was already able to cd to `Administrator` but can't see stuff so i knew that uac was blocking it so i needed creds for hugo so that i can login via rdp since rdp port was open when we did nmap scan we saw that 

so i go `PrivescCheck.ps1` and ran it do find the creds. and i found it

![](https://i.imgur.com/IKNYADu.png?1)

and from the creds i found i just rdp into the machine as user hugo
```bash
xfreerdp /u:hugo /v:10.10.116.150
```

and then run cmd as `Administrator` and then accept the UAC and that's how we get the root flag.
