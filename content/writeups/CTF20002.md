## Enumeration:

```bash
nmap -sC -sV <IP>
```

And I Found Port 22 and 80 open

#### Port 80

Upon visiting port 80 i came across this `mzee-av` stuff, googling about this, I didn't find anything on the internet.

```bash
=====================================================

```

Running Gobuster reveals a directory by the name of `/backups` 

Visiting `/backups` we find **Backup.zip**

Once Downloaded we unzip it and find

```bash
unzip backup.zip 
Archive:  backup.zip
   creating: var/www/html/
   creating: var/www/html/upload/
  inflating: var/www/html/upload/wget.exe  
  inflating: var/www/html/upload/whoami.exe  
 extracting: var/www/html/upload/index.html  
  inflating: var/www/html/listing.php  
  inflating: var/www/html/upload.php  
  inflating: var/www/html/index.html  
```

So now it's time to review the code and find how this "AV" works :')

#### Understanding the upload.php

```php
<?php

/* Get the name of the uploaded file */
$filename = $_FILES['file']['name'];

/* Choose where to save the uploaded file */
$tmp_location = "upload/file.tmp";
$location = "upload/".$filename;


/* Move the file temporary */
move_uploaded_file($_FILES['file']['tmp_name'], $tmp_location);



/* Check MagicBytes MZ PEFILE 4D5A*/
$F=fopen($tmp_location,"r");
$magic=fread($F,2);
fclose($F);
$magicbytes = strtoupper(substr(bin2hex($magic),0,4)); 
error_log(print_r("Magicbytes:" . $magicbytes, TRUE));

/* if its not a PEFILE block it - str_contains onlz php 8*/
//if ( ! (str_contains($magicbytes, '4D5A'))) {
if ( strpos($magicbytes, '4D5A') === false ) {
    echo "Error no valid PEFILE\n";
    error_log(print_r("No valid PEFILE", TRUE));
    error_log(print_r("MagicBytes:" . $magicbytes, TRUE));
    exit ();
}

rename($tmp_location, $location);



?>
```

> **Breakdown**:

**. Getting File Information:**

- **`$filename = $_FILES['file']['name'];`:** Assigns the name of the uploaded file to the variable `$filename`.
- **`$tmp_location = "upload/file.tmp";`:** Sets a temporary location to store the uploaded file.
- **`$location = "upload/".$filename;`:** Specifies the final destination for the file within the "upload" directory.

**2. Moving the File Temporarily:**

- **`move_uploaded_file($_FILES['file']['tmp_name'], $tmp_location);`:** Moves the uploaded file from its temporary server location to the specified `$tmp_location`.

**3. Checking for PE File Signature:**

- **`fopen($tmp_location, "r");`:** Opens the temporary file in read mode.
- **`$magic = fread($F, 2);`:** Reads the first two bytes of the file, which often contain a file signature.
- **`fclose($F);`:** Closes the file.
- **`$magicbytes = strtoupper(substr(bin2hex($magic), 0, 4));`:** Converts the first two bytes to hexadecimal format, uppercases them, and truncates them to 4 characters. This is used to check for the signature "4D5A", which indicates a PE file (Portable Executable) on Windows systems.

**4. Validating the PE File Signature:**

- **`if (strpos($magicbytes, '4D5A') === false) { ... }`:** Checks if the `$magicbytes` do not contain the "4D5A" signature.
  - If the signature is not found:
    - Prints an error message.
    - Logs error messages for debugging.
    - Terminates the script using `exit()`.

**5. Moving the File to Final Destination:**

- **`rename($tmp_location, $location);`:** Renames the temporary file to its final name in the specified `$location` directory, effectively moving it to its permanent location.

**In summary, this code handles a file upload, validates if it's a PE file (commonly used for Windows executables), and moves it to a designated location if it passes the validation.**

## Getting User:

So, now we know where the file gets uploaded, what checks are done now it's time to get a shell via file upload (.php shell)

Uploading .php reverse shell and i intercept the web request

as you can see we get the file uploaded successfully

and once we visit `/upload/rev.php` we get the shell.

## PrivEsc:

Running LinPEAS gave me this strange SUID at `/opt` named as *fileS*

![](https://i.imgur.com/bsLL4FF.png)

Checking the file via `ls -al`, we can only execute the file. Trying to execute the file, it just recursive list all file in current directory

```bash
www-data@mzeeav:/opt$ ./fileS /root
/root
/root/proof.txt
/root/email2.txt
/root/.bashrc
/root/.local
/root/.local/share
/root/.local/share/nano
/root/.bash_history
/root/.profile
```

there wasn't really a way to find how the binary works until i reverse the binary but i highly doubt that's the approach so i just tried the basic stuff which is running

```bash
./fileS --version
```

and i found that it's nothing but the `find` binary, so just a quick visit to [gtfo](https://gtfobins.github.io/gtfobins/find/#suid)
