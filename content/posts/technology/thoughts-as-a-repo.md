## Thoughts-As-a-Repository using a GitHub Repository

Just a left-brain exercise, on how would I introduced philosophical thinking in Software and how it might
look like a Git repository

I will keep it less  verbose and more visual.

### Aim

It is not intented for any audience, or for all if it clicks. I have no control of what the
outcomes are and I am satisfied with that.

### Repository

[Repository](https://github.com/shantanoo-desai/philosophical-repo)

### Status Quo

A while ago I was living:

{{< figure src="/images/technology/stoicism/00_gradual_life_progress_commit.png" title="Life was Progressing" >}}


But then something started to _bug_ me.

{{< figure src="/images/technology/stoicism/01_report_bug_issue.png" title="Bug Report: Lacking Satisfaction in Life" >}}

Something had to be done, and I had to find a path.

{{< figure src="/images/technology/stoicism/01_a_roadmap_comment.png" title="Development Roadmap Comment on Bug Report" >}}

I stumbled upon something interesting and it caught my attention. So I branched out into a _development_ stage and whether
I would reach somewhere rather than being nowhere.

{{< figure src="/images/technology/stoicism/02_conduct_research_development_branch.png" title="Branch out into a Development Stage" >}}

I started gather information on __Stoicism__ like the arm-chair researcher I was and jotted somethings down.

[Initial Investigations on Stoicism](https://github.com/shantanoo-desai/philosophical-repo/blob/main/00_Investigrations.md)

{{< figure src="/images/technology/stoicism/03_research_reference_commit.png" title="High Level Research Reference Commit" >}}

I started to like this __Stoicism__ and decided to compile something useful, that I can comprehend.


{{< figure src="/images/technology/stoicism/04_core_concept_chore_issue.png" title="Conduct a Chore of Core Concepts of Stoicism" >}}

Guilty as charged, in terms of my _Goldfish Attention Span_ I did compile somethings valuable that I can go through easily about 
Stoicism

[Core Concepts/Principles in Layman Terms](https://github.com/shantanoo-desai/philosophical-repo/blob/main/01_CorePrinciples.md)

{{< figure src="/images/technology/stoicism/05_doc_concepts_chore_completed.png" title="Compile a Document on Core Concepts of Stoicism" >}}

I started practicing simple things in everyday life and I was ready to accept certain values in my life.

{{< figure src="/images/technology/stoicism/06_Pull_request_development.png" title="Create a Pull Request in my current lifestyle" >}}

I felt a bit more satisfied, less anxious and more in control of my thought process. This feels good!

{{< figure src="/images/technology/stoicism/07_bump_satisfaction_main_commit.png" title="Bump satisfaction version from v0.0 to v0.5" >}}

What if, I can bring this thought process also to Software, into things at work or also for my personal projects that will help me grow?

{{< figure src="/images/technology/stoicism/08_feature_request_practicality_issue.png" title="Feature Request: add practical approach" >}}

Got my thoughts together and started practicing them. I seem to be doing good, better than where I started from.

[Journal Entry of practicing Stoicism in Software](https://github.com/shantanoo-desai/philosophical-repo/blob/main/StoicCode.md)

{{< figure src="/images/technology/stoicism/09_add_stoic_code_commit.png" title="Add Stoic Coding Concepts that work for Me." >}}

I think I can commit to these practices to the best of abilities everyday at work or for personal projects

{{< figure src="/images/technology/stoicism/10_add_feature_via_pull-request.png" title="Create a Pull Request of Stoic Coding in main lifestyle" >}}

Seems like it is working. Less anxiety, more resilience, a lot of satisfaction! Time to bump that satisfaction version.

{{< figure src="/images/technology/stoicism/11_bump_satisfaction_to_v1.png" title="Bump satisfaction to v1.0" >}}

## Future Roadmap

- Read Books by __Marcus Aurelius__, __Seneca__, __Epictetus__
- Find methods out for practical philosophy to keep the version bumps rolling till I roll into a grave.

Till then remember:
