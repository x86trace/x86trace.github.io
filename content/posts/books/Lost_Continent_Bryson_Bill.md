Bill Bryson's travel through rural USA is something right down my lane along with
the great writings of Paul Theroux, and Ryszard Kapuscinski.

Some notes from Bryson's travels that I found.

> I drove and drove, through flat farming country and little towns devoid of life:
> Hull, Pittsfield, Barry, Oxville. On my map, Springfield was two inches to the
> right of Hannibal, but it seemed to take hours to get there. In fact it does
> not take hours to get there. I was only slowly adjusting to the continental
> scale of America, where states are the size of countries. Illinois is nearly
> twice as big as Austria, four times the size of Switzerland. There is so much
> emptiness, so much space between towns. You go through a little place and the 
> dinette looks crowded, so you think, 'oh, I'll wait till I get to Fuddville before
> I stop for coffee', because it's only just down the road and then you get out on
> the highway and a sign says __FUDDVILLE 102 Miles__. And you realize that you are
> dealing with another scale of geography altogether. There is corresponding lack
> of detail on the maps. On British maps every church and public house is dutifully
> recorded. Rivers of laughable minuteness - rivers you can step across - are landmarks
> of importance, known for miles around. In America, whole towns go missing - places with
> schools, businesses, hundreds of quite little lives, just vanish, as effectively as if
> they had been vaporized.

__Context__: Bill Bryson is in Philadelphia living at his friend's place

> In the evening I sat in Hal and Lucia's house, eating their food, drinking their wine,
> admiring their children and their house and furniture and possessions, their easy wealth
> and comfort, and felt a sap for ever having left America. Life was so abundant here, so
> easy, so convenient. Suddenly I wanted a refridgerator that made its own ice-cubes and
> a waterproof radio for the shower. I wanted an electric orange juicer and room ionizer
> and a write watch that would keep in touch with biorythms. I wanted it all. Once in the
> evening I went upstairs to go to the bathroom and walked past one of the children's bedrooms.
> The door was open and a bedside light was on. There were toys everywhere - on the floor, on
> the shelves, tumbling out of a wooden trunk. It looked like Santa's workshop. But there was
> nothing extraordinary about this; it was just a typical middle-class American bedroom.
>
> And you should see American closets. They are always full of yesterday's enthusiasm: golf-clubs,
> scuba diving equipment, tennis-rackets, exercise machines, tape recorders, darkroom equipments,
> objects that once excited their owner and then were replaced by other objects even more shiny
> and exciting. That is the great, seductive thing about America - the people always get what they
> want, right now, whether it is good for them or not. There is something deeply worrying, and
> awesomely irresponsible about this endless self-gratification, this constant appeal to the baser
> instincts.
>
> "Do you want zillions of your state taxes even at the risk of crippling education?"
> "Oh, yes!", the people cry.
>
> "Do you want TV that would make an imbecile weep?"
> "Yes, please!"
>
> Shall we indulge ourselves with the greatest orgy of consumer spending that the world has even
> known? 'Sounds neat, let's go for it'.
>
> The whole of the global economy is based on supplying the cravings of two percent of the world's
> population. If Americans suddenly stopped indulging themselves, or ran out of closet space,
> the world would fall apart. If you ask me, that's crazy.
>
> I should point out that I am not talking about Hal and Lucia in all this. They are good people
> and lead modest and responsible lives. Their closets aren't full of scuba diving equipment and
> seldom-used tennis rackets. They are full of mundane items like buckets and galoshes, earmuffs
> and scouring powder. I know this for a fact because late in the night when everyone was asleep
> I crept out of bed and had a good look.

> In the morning I drove to Wyoming, through scenery that looked like illustration from some
> marvellous children's book of western tales - snowy peaks, pine forests, snug farms, a twisting
> river, a mountain vale whith a comely name: Swan Valley. That is the one thing that must be said
> for the men and women who carved out the West. They certainly knew how to name a place. Just on
> this corner of the map I could see Soda Springs, Massacre Rocks, Steam boat Mountain, Wind River,
> Flaming Gorge, Calamity Falls - places whose very names promised adventure and excitment, even if
> in reality all they contained were a DX gas station and a Taster-Freer drive-in.
>
> Most of the early settlers in America were oddly inept at devising place-names. They either chose
> unimaginative semi-recycled names - New York, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New England - or toadying,
> kiss-ass names like Virginia, Georgia, Maryland and Jamestown in a generally pitiable attempt to
> secure favour with some monarch or powdered aristocrat back home. Or else they just accepted the name
> Indians told them, not knowing whether Squashaninsect meant 'Land of the Twinkling Lakes' or 'Place
> where Big Chief Thunderclap paused to pass water'.
>
> The Spanish were even worse because they gave everything religious names so that every place in the 
> South-West is called San this or Santa that. Driving across the South-West is like an 800-mile
> religion procession. The worst name on the whole continent is Sangre de Cristo Mountains, which means
> 'Blood of Christ Mountains'. Have you heard of a more inane name of any geographical feature?
> It was only here in the real West, the land of beaver trappers and mountain men, that a dollop of
> romance and colour was brought to the business of giving names. And here I was about to enter one
> of the most beautiful and understatedly romantic of them all: __Jackson Hole__.
