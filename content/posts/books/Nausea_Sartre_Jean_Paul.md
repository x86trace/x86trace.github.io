My initial bouts of Existentialism was through the works of Albert Camus
and through Nausea by Jean-Paul Sartre. Antoine Roquotine in despair makes you
ponder upon the questions of your own existence.

Some excerpts from Antoine Roqoutine's Diary:

> So, today, I was looking at the fawn-coloured boots of a cavalry office who
> was coming out of the barracks. As I followed them with my eyes, I saw a piece of
> paper lying beside a puddle. I thought that the officer was going to crush the paper
> into the mud with his heel, but no: with a single step he strode over the paper and
> puddle. I went upto it: it was a lined page, probably torn out of a school notebook.
> The rain had drenched and twisted it, and it was covered with blisters and swellings,
> like a burnt hand. The red line of the margin had blurred into a pink smear, the ink
> had run into places. The bottom of the page was hidden by a crust of mud. I bent down,
> already looking forward to touching this fresh and tender pulp which would roll into 
> grey balls in my fingers.
> ... I couldn't do it.
> I stayed in a bent position for a moment, I read: 'Dictation: The White Owl', then I
> straightened up, empty handed. I am no longer free, I can no longer do what I want.
> Objects out not to touch, since they are not alive. You use them, you put them back
> in place, you live among them: they are useful, nothing more. But they touch me, it's
> unbearable. I am afraid of entering in contact with them, just as if they were living
> animals.
>
> Now I see; I remember better what I felt the other day on the sea-shore when I was 
> holdingthat pebble. It was a sort of sweet disgust. How unpleasant it was! And it came
> from the pebble, I'm sure of that, it passed from the pebble into my hand. Yes, that's it,
> that's exactly it: A sort of Nausea in the hands.

> I haven't had any adventures. Things have happened to me, events, incidents, anything you
> like. But not adventures. It isn't a matter of words; I am beginning to understand. There
> is something I longed for more that all the rest - without realizing it properly. It wasn't
> love, heaven forbid, nor glory, nor wealth. It was ... anyway, I had imagined that at certain
> moments my life could take on a rare and precious quality. There was no need for extraordinary
> circumstances: all I asked for was a little order. There is nothing very splendid about my
> life at present: but now and then, for example when they played music in cafes, I would look
> back and say to myself: in the old days, in London, in Meknes, Tokyo, I have had wonderful
> moments, I have had adventures. It is that which has been taken away from me now. I have just
> learnt, all of a sudden, for no apparent reason, that I have been lying to myself for ten years.
> Adventures are in books. And naturally, everything they tell you about in books can happen in
> real life, but not in the same way. It was to this way of happening that I attached so much
> importance.

> First of all the beginnings would have to be real beginnings. Alas! now I can see so clearly
> what I wanted. Real beginnings, appearing like a fanfare of trumpets, like the first notes of
> a jazz tune, abruptly, cutting boredom short, strengthening duration; evenings among those 
> evenings of which you later say: 'I was out walking, it was an evening in May'. You are walking
> along, the moon has just risen, you feel idle, vacant, a little empty. And then all of a sudden
> you think: 'Something has happened'. It might be anything: a slight crackling sound in the shadows,
> a fleeting silhouette crossing the street. But this slight event isn't like the others: straight
> away you see that it is the predecesosor of a great form whose outlines are lost in the mist and
> you tell you too: 'Something is beginning'.
>
> Something begins in order to end: an adventure doesn't let itself be extended; it achieves
> significance only through its death. Towards this death, which may also be my own, I am 
> drawn irrevocably. Each moment I cling with all my heart: I know that it is unique, irreplacable -
> and yet I would not lift a finger to prevent it from being annihilated. This last minute I am sleeping -
> in Berlin, in London - in the arms of this woman whom I met two days ago - a minute I love passionately,
> a woman I am close to loving - it is going to come to an end, I know that. In a little while I shall
> leave for another country. I shall never find this woman again or this night. I study each second,
> I try to suck it dry; nothing pauses which I do not seize, which I do not fix forever within me, 
> nothing, neither the ephemeral tenderness of these lovely eyes, nor the noises in the street, nor
> the false light of dawn: and yet the minute goes by and I do not hold it back, I am glad to see it pass.
>
> And then all of a sudden, something breaks off sharply. The adventure is over, time resumes its
> everyday slackness. I turn around; behind me, that beautiful melodious form plunges completely 
> into the past. It grows smaller, shrinking as it sinks, and now the end is simply one with the
> beginning. Following the golden spot with my eyes, I think that I would agree - even if I had
> nearly died, lost a fortune, a friend - to live it all over again, in the same circumstances, 
> from beginning to end. But an adventure never begins again, is never prolonged.

> Anny used to get the most out of time. When she was at Djibouti and I was at Aden, and I used
> to go see her for twenty-four hours, she contrived to multiply the misunderstandings between us
> until there were only sixty minutes, exactly sixty minutes, before I had to leave; sixty minutes,
> just long enough to make you feel the seconds passing one by one. I remember one of those
> terrible evenings. I had to leave at midnight. We had gone to an open air cinema; we were
> desperately unhappy, she as much as I. Only she led the dance. At eleven O'clock at the
> beginning of the main picture, she took my hand and pressed it between her hands without a word.
> I felt myself flooded with a bitter joy and I understood, without needing to look at my watch,
> that it was eleven o'clock. From that moment on we began to feel the minutes passing. That time
> we were leaving each other for three months. At one moment they projected a completely white-picture
> on the screen, the darkness lifted, and I saw that Anny was crying. Then, at midnight, she let go
> of my hand, after pressing it violently; I got up and left without saying a single word to her.
> That was a job well done.

__Context__: Sitting in a bar/cafe with 2 other men: Monsieur Achille and Doctor Rogé. Doctor Rogé is a bit
arrogant and making fun of Achille by stating he is a crackpot. Antoine ponders on this thought and can't
help feeling ashamed for Achille.

> How I should like tell him (Achille) that he's being duped, that he's playing into the hand of
> self-important people. Professionals in experience? They have dragged out their lives in stupor and
> somnolence, they have married in a hurry out of impatience, and they have made children at random.
> They have met other men in cafes, at weddings, at funerals. Now and then, caught in a current,
> they have struggled without understanding what was happening to them. Everything that had happened
> around them has begun and ended out of their sight; long obscure shapes, events from afar, have
> brushed rapidly past them, and when they have tried to look at them, everything was already over.
> And then, about forty, they baptize their stubborn ideas and a few proverbs with the name of 
> Experience they begin to imitate slot machines; put a coin in the slot on the left and out come
> anecdotes wrapped in silver paper; put a coin in the slot on the right and you get precious pieces
> of advice which stick to your teeth like soft caramels. At this rate, I could get myself invited
> to people's houses and they would tell one another that I was a great traveller in the sight of 
> Eternity.
>
> Yes: the Moslims squat to pass water; instead of ergotine. Hindu midwives use ground glass in 
> cow dung; in Borneo, when a girl has a period, she spends three days and nights on the roof of her 
> house. I have seen burials in gondolas in Venice, the Holy Week festivities in Sevilla, the Passion
> play at Oberammergau. Naturally, that's just a tiny sample of my Experience: I could lean back
> in a chair and begin with a smile:
> ' Do you know Jihdava, Madame? It is a curious little town in Morovia where I stayed in 1924..'

__Context__: Feeling haunted by his work and presence while writing a book Monseiur de Roblebon

> I picked up my pen and tried to get back to work; I was sick to death of these reflections
> on the past, the present, the world. I asked for only one thing: to be allowed to finish my book
> in peace.
>
> But as my eyes fell on the pad of white sheets,  I was struck by its appearance, and I stayed there,
> my pen raised, gazing at that dazzling paper: how hard and brilliant it was, how present it was.
> There was nothing in it that wasn't present. The letters which I had just written on it were not dry
> yet and already they no longer belonged to me.
> 
>  'Care had been taken to spread the most sinister rumours...'
>
> I had thought out this sentence, to begin with it had been a litle of myself. Now it had been
> engraved in the paper, it had taken sides against me. I no longer recognized it, I couldn't
> even think of it out again. It was there, in front of me; it would have been useless for me to look
> at it for some sign of origin. Anybody else could have written it. But I, I wasn't sure that I had
> written it. The letters didn't shine any more, they were dry. That too had disappeared; nothing
> remained of their ephemeral brilliance. I looked anxiously around me: the present, nothing but
> the present. Light and solid piece of furniture, encrusted in their present, a table, a bed, a wardrobe
> with a mirror - and me. The true nature of the present revealed itself: it was that which exists,
> and all that was not present did not exist. The past did not exist. Not at all. Neither in things
> nor even in my thoughts. True, I had realized a long time before that my past had escaped me. But
> until then I believed that it had simply gone out of my range. For me the past was only pensioning
> off: it was another was existing, a state of holiday and inactivity; each event, when it had played
> its part, dutifully packed itself, away in a box and became an honorary event: we find it so difficult
> to imagine nothingness. Now I knew, things are entirely what they appear to be and behind them
> ... there is nothing.
