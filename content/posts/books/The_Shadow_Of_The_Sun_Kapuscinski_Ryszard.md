Another one of Kapuscinski's work in Africa. __The Shadow of the Sun__ illustrates how Colonial Africa started taking baby steps into developing nations.

## Road to Kumasi

### The Three Worlds of Africa

> _The spiritual world of "African" (if one may use the term despite its gross simplification) is rich and complex, and his inner life is permeated by a profound religiosity.
 He believes in the coexistence of three different yet related worlds._
>
> _The first is the one that surrounds us, the palpable and visible reality composed of living people, animals, and plants, as well as inanimate objects: stones, water, air._
>
> _The second is the world of the ancestors, those who died before us, but who died, as it were, not completely, not finally, not absolutely. Indeed, in a meta physical sense they continue to exist, and are even capable of participating in our life, of influencing it, shaping it. That is why maintaining good relations with ones's ancestors is a 
precondition of a successful life, and sometimes even of life itself._
>
> _The third world is the rich kingdom of the spirits - spirits that exist independently, yet at the same time are present in every being, in every object, in everything and everywhere._


### Comprehension of Time

> _We climb into the bus and sit down. At this point there is a risk of culture clash, of collisions and conflict. It will undoubtedly occur if the passenger is a foreigner who
doesn't know Africa. Someone like that wil start looking around, squirming, inquiring **"When will the bus leave?"**_
>
> _"What do you mean, when?" The astonished driver will reply. **"It will leave when we find enough people to fill it up."**_
>
> _The Europeans and the Africans have an entirely different concept of time. In the European worldview, time exists outside man, exists objectively, and has measurable and
 linear characteristics. According to Newton, time is absolute: **"Absolute, true, mathematical time of itself and from its own nature, it flows equably and without relation to
 anything external"**. The European feels himself to be time's slave, dependent on it, subject to it. To exist and function, he must observe its ironclad, inviolate laws, its 
 inflexible principles and rules. He must need deadlines, dates, days and hours. He moves within the rigor of time and cannot exist outside them. They impose upon him their 
 requirements and quotas. An unresolvable conflict exists between man and time, one that always ends with man's defeat - time annihilates him._
>
> _Africans apprehend time differently. For them, it is much looser concept, more open, elastic, subjective. It is a man who influences time, its shape, course and rhythm (man
acting, of course, with the consent of gods and ancestors). Time is even something that that man can create outright, for time is made manifest through events, and whether an 
event takes place or not depends, after all, on man alone. If two armies do not engage in a battle, then that battle will not occur (in other words, time will not have revealed 
its presence, will not have come into being)._
>
> _Time appears as a result of our actions, and vanishes when we neglect or ignore it. It is something that springs to life under our influence, but falls into a state of 
hibernation, even non-existence, if we do not direct our energy towards it. It is a subservient, passive essence, and, most importantly, one dependent on man._
>
> _The absolute opposite of time as it is understood in the European worldview._
>
> _In practical terms, this means that if you go to a village where a meeting is scheduled for the afternoon but find no one at the appointed spot, asking **"When will the meeting take place?"** makes no sense. You know the answer: **"It will take place when people come"**._
>
> _Therefore the African who boards a bus sits down in a vacant seat, and immediately falls into a state in which he spends a great portion of his life: a benumbed waiting._
