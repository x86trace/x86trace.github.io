__Ryszard Kapuscinski__ is one of my favourite authors who reported his experiences during the tumultuous times in Africa and Middle East.

The Shah of Shahs was one of his works about the ruler of Iran and his downfall: [__Mohammed Reza Pahlavi__](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mohammad_Reza_Pahlavi).

As it is quite prevelant in present geo-political situation, Iran is, and will always be about Oil.

The book is a fantastic view into how the Shah of Iran went into a declining spiral and never looked at his people's needs. __Reza Pahlavi__ thought
of modernising Iran through its rich oil resources without even trying to comprehend Iranians' needs and wants.

Here is one of the best description from the book about Oil:

> _Oil kindles extraordinary emotions and hopes, since oil is above all, a great temptation. It is the temptation of ease, wealth, strength, fortune, power.
It is filthy, foul-smelling, liquid that squirts obligingly up into the air and falls back to earth as a rustling shower of money. To discover and possess
the source of oil it is feel as if, after wandering long underground, you have suddenly stumbled upon royal treasure. Not only do you become rich, but you are also
visited by the mystical conviction that some higher power has looked upon you with the eye of grace and magnanimously elevated you above others electing you its favourite.
Many photographs preserve the moment when the first oil spurts from the well: people jumping from joy, falling into each other's arms, weeping._
>
> _Oil creates the illusion of a completely changed life, life without work, life for free. Oil is a resource that anesthesizes thought, blurs vision, corrupts.
People from poor countries go around thinking: **God, if only we had oil!** The concept of oil expresses perfectly the eternal human dream of wealth achieved through lucky accidents, through a kiss of fortune and not by sweat, anguish, hard work. In this sense oil is a fairy tale and, like every fairy tale, a bit of lie. Oil fills us with such
arrogance that we begin believing we can easily overcome such unyielding obstacles as time.  With oil, the last Shah used to say, **I will create a second America in a generation!**_
>
> _He never created it._
>
> _Oil though powerful, has its defect. It does not replace thinking or wisdom._
>
> _For rulers, one of its most alluring qualities, is that it strengthens authority. Oil produces great profits without pulling a lot of people to work. Oil causes few social
problems because it creates neither a numerous proletariat nor a sizeable bougeousie. Thus the government, freed from the need of splitting the profits with anyone, can dispose
of them according to its own ideas and desires. Look at the ministers from oil countries, how high they hold their heads, what a sense of power they have, they, the lords of 
energy, who decide whether we will be driving cars tomorrow or walking._

> _And oil's relation to the mosque? What vigor, glory, and significance this new wealth has given to its 
religion, Islam, which is enjoying a period of accelerated expansion and attracting new crowds of the faithful._
