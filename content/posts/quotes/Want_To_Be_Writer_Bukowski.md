Charles Bukowski has a way with words blunt but profound and this among many of his works is befitting for someone who _writes_ albeit with a keyboard!

> _Unless it comes unmasked out of your heart and your mind and your mouth and your gut,_
>
> _don't do it._
>
> _If you have to sit for hours staring at your computer screen_
>
> _or hunched over your_
> _typewriter_
>
> _searching for words,_
>
> _don't do it._
>
> _If you are doing it for money or fame,_
>
> _don't do it._

>
> _don't do it._
>
> _If it's hard work just thinking about it,_
>
> _don't do it._
>
> _If you are trying to write like someone else,_
>
> _forget about it._
>
> _If you have to wait for it to come out of you,_
>
> _then wait patiently._
>
> _If it never does roar out of you,_
>

>
> _don't be dull and boring and pretentious,_
>
> _don't be consumed with self-love_
>
> _The libraries of the world have_
>
> _yawned themselves to sleep_
>

> _suicide or murder,_
>
> _don't do it._
>
> _Unless the sun inside you is,_
> 
> _burning your gut,_
>
> _don't do it._
>
> _When it's truly time,_
>
> _and if you have been chosen,_
>
> _it will do it by itself and it will keep on doing it,_
>
> _until you die or it dies in you._
>
> _There is no other way,_
>
> _and there never was._

A video that I remember that I really like about Bukowski was his awareness of being in the present and his __Crappy Life__.
